# Foundry VTT Star Trek Adventures - Next Generation Implementation

This implementation of the [Star Trek Adventures](https://www.modiphius.net/pages/star-trek-adventures) games system is a re-engineering effort based on the [original implementation](https://github.com/mkscho63/sta) done by [@mkscho63](https://github.com/mkscho63).
As such, it uses the same licensing as the original version.

The primary goals of this implementation are:

* Having a typed implementation based on [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and the great [foundry-vtt-types](https://github.com/League-of-Foundry-Developers/foundry-vtt-types).
* Possessing a clean architecture, separating core/domain logic from UI logic.
* Providing a rock-solid base for future expansions.
* Adapting and extending the data model to be more cleanly structured.
* Making full use of the infrastructure provided by [Foundry Virtual Tabletop](https://foundryvtt.com/).

## Compatibility

As of the time of writing, the data model is fully compatible with the original implementation.
This is expected to change in the future, in order to allow for the schema to updated and adjusted to better reflect Foundry Virtual Tabletop standards and the game system as well.

## Content

This game system **does not** include any parts of the Star Trek Adventures game system and rules that are not strictly necessary to implement this system.
